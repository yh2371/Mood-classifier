1. Run packages and functions

2. For the classifier and generator, please run the code in order
   Note: The metadata as well as the dataset were uploaded in a zip file called Data.zip, please unzip before running the code.

3. Please do not run the composition part directly
   The composition part will either create a file in your directory
   or play the audio in the notebook
   For the dialogue part, only the first sentence will be played, please
   put the rest into separate In[] boxes to play them.
   
   Please modify the composition part according to the result you are
   seeking (playing audio or getting file) before running the code.
